# Usage

## Initialize Settings

```sh
dmp config init
```

Set the Discord application client ID:

```sh
dmp config set discord.client_id YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID
```

## Check Diagnostics

```sh
dmp diagnostics
```

Diagnostics report whether settings exist, Discord IPC is available, and each source is configured, disabled, unsupported, or unavailable. Secrets are not printed.

## Probe Sources

Poll enabled sources once without updating Discord:

```sh
dmp probe
```

## Run The Bridge

```sh
dmp run
```

Run once and exit:

```sh
dmp run --once
```

Run without updating Discord:

```sh
dmp run --dry-run
```

Discord may still show the registered application name as the Rich Presence app label. DisMusicPresence sends the formatted media text as the activity details and asks Discord to use details for the visible status text where supported. Long media text is shortened before sending because Discord limits Rich Presence text fields.

## Artwork

Filebin is the default artwork provider. If no Filebin path is configured, Apple Music tracks export the current Music.app artwork and upload it to Filebin. If local artwork is unavailable, Apple Music tracks use Apple/iTunes catalog artwork when a match is found.

Use a public custom artwork URL:

```sh
dmp config set artwork.provider custom_url
dmp config set artwork.custom_url https://example.com/artwork.png
```

Use Filebin for a local custom image:

```sh
dmp config set artwork.provider filebin
dmp config set artwork.filebin.path .private/artwork.png
```

Filebin uploads are temporary public files. DisMusicPresence keeps the uploaded image alive while the presence is active and deletes it on shutdown by default. If deletion fails, Filebin also expires uploads automatically.

Disable automatic Apple Music artwork export:

```sh
dmp config set artwork.apple_music.enabled false
```

Use only Apple/iTunes catalog artwork:

```sh
dmp config set artwork.provider apple_catalog
```

## Publish A Test Presence

```sh
dmp test-presence
```

This requires Discord to be running and `discord.client_id` to be configured.

## Apple Music Notes

Apple Music support is macOS-only. If macOS asks for automation permission, allow the terminal or app host running DisMusicPresence to control Music.

Paused or stopped Apple Music playback does not publish stale listening presence.

## Plex Notes

Plex support can use Tautulli or direct Plex server API.

For Tautulli:

```sh
dmp config set plex.enabled true
dmp config set plex.provider auto
dmp config set plex.user_names YOUR_PLEX_NAME,YOUR_TAUTULLI_DISPLAY_NAME
dmp config set tautulli.url http://YOUR_TAUTULLI_HOST:8181
dmp config set tautulli.api_key YOUR_TAUTULLI_API_KEY
```

For direct Plex server API:

```sh
dmp config set plex.enabled true
dmp config set plex.provider plex
dmp config set plex.user_names YOUR_PLEX_NAME
dmp config set plex.url http://YOUR_PLEX_HOST:32400
dmp config set plex.token YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN
```

Use `plex.user_names` for every name that may identify the same Plex user. For example, if Plex shows `AznIronMan` but Tautulli session activity shows `Geoff`, set `plex.user_names` to `AznIronMan,Geoff`.

Movies format as `Watching Movie Name`. TV episodes format as `Watching Show Name - SxxExx - Episode Name`.
