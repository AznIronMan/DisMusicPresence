## Artifact Policy

Current releases ship as source plus standard Python package artifacts:

- Source checkout or GitHub source archive from the release tag.
- Python wheel.
- Python source distribution.

Standalone macOS, Windows, or Linux app bundles are not part of current releases. Generated artifacts belong in `dist/` and are ignored by git.

Build artifacts:

```sh
python -m pip install build
python -m build
```

Verify the wheel in a clean virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/dmp-release-check
/tmp/dmp-release-check/bin/python -m pip install dist/dis_media_presence-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
/tmp/dmp-release-check/bin/dmp version
```
