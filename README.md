# DisMusicPresence

Version: `1.0.0`
Last updated: `2026-06-17`

DisMusicPresence is a local presence bridge for Discord. It reads active playback from Apple Music, Plex, and future media sources, then publishes configurable Discord presence text such as:

- `Listening to Artist - Song`
- `Watching Movie Name`
- `Watching Show Name - S01E02 - Episode Name`

The project is developed by Street Kings Productions, a Clark & Burke LLC company, for internal use first. It is open to the public for use, study, forks, and builds.

## Current Status

`1.0.0` is the first stable public release. It includes:

- Python CLI package with `dmp` command.
- Local settings file named `dmp.settings`.
- Interactive setup menu for common Discord, source priority, Apple Music, Plex, and artwork settings.
- Source priority controls for deciding whether Apple Music or Plex wins when both are active.
- Status command showing current source priority and the active source that would update Discord.
- Configurable listening and watching format templates.
- Apple Music source provider for macOS.
- Best-effort Apple Music source provider for Windows through Windows media sessions.
- Plex source provider through Tautulli or direct Plex server API fallback.
- Plex diagnostics with backend reachability and configured-user session counts.
- Plex hardening for paused, buffering, remote-client, transcoded, movie, episode, and artwork fallback cases.
- Discord local IPC integration with connect, update, clear, and diagnostic behavior.
- Optional Discord artwork assets from a public custom URL, Tmpfiles-uploaded local image, Tmpfiles-uploaded current Apple Music artwork, Tmpfiles-uploaded Plex artwork, Filebin, or Apple/iTunes catalog lookup.
- Automatic Apple Music artwork export through Music.app when temporary artwork hosting is enabled and no local artwork path is configured.
- Apple/iTunes catalog fallback when local Apple Music artwork export is unavailable.
- Runtime loop with source priority, polling, dry-run mode, and shutdown cleanup.
- Startup guidance and editable macOS/Linux service templates for regular local use.
- Unit tests using Python standard library `unittest`.

Windows and Linux are not primary test targets yet. Plex support is designed to be platform-neutral. Apple Music on Windows is best-effort, untested, and unsupported until validated on a Windows machine with Apple Music installed.

## Quick Start

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
dmp config init
dmp config set discord.client_id YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID
dmp setup
dmp diagnostics
dmp run
```

For macOS Apple Music only, the default source settings are enough once Discord is configured. For Plex, enable and configure either Tautulli or direct Plex server API settings.

## Project Rules

- Keep source attribution and license notices intact when using, forking, or redistributing this project.
- Do not vendor third-party dependencies into this repository. Dependencies should be declared in project metadata and documentation when added.
- Keep local secrets, tokens, settings, logs, caches, and generated build output out of git.
- Public documentation should track user-visible behavior by version number.
- Changes should use semantic versioning: `major.minor.patch`.

## Versioning

This project started at `0.0.1`.

- Patch changes: documentation updates, bug fixes, small internal maintenance, and compatible behavior fixes.
- Minor changes: new sources, new formatting features, new configuration options, and other meaningful feature additions.
- Major changes: broad rewrites, major user interface changes, incompatible configuration changes, or major application architecture changes.

`1.0.0` is the first stable public release for the Apple Music and Plex bridge. Future media sources should use minor-version releases unless they require incompatible changes.
